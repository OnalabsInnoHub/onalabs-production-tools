# ‚ö°Ô∏è Onalabs Inno-Hub BioT Upload Tool

The goal of the following Python script is to upload Onalab's devices to BioT and add them to an existing organization with a registration code to identify them. The steps to do so are:

1. Check if the BioT organization exists.
2. Upload the registration code.
3. Upload the device into an organization and assign a registration code to it. 

## üöö Integration with Logistic Excel
This script will be mainly used as an integration to the Logistic excel. In this case, only devices which follow the following conditions should be sent for upload:
1. "BioT" column is empty.
2. "BioT organization" column has an organization assigned.
Moreover once the script has finished the result should be added to the column "BioT" of the corresponding device.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Script Arguments

The script requires at least 9 arguments.

### Example

```shell

  -description "ONAS0000" \
  -version "2.0.0" \
  -output "C:\Users\Usuari\OS\PROD\shipping"
```

## üìùTraceability File

### Terminology

The name of the Traceability File must contain the serial number and the current timestamp, in the following format: `1XXXXXXXXXXXX_YYMMDD.json>`.

- `1XXXXXXXXXXXX`: Serial Number of the device.
- `YYMMDD`: Date in which the script has been executed.

### File Information
The traceability file must contain the result of the operation, including the serial number and the outcome of the upload. Use '0' if the device was uploaded correctly, or an error code indicating the reason for failure.

```json
{
  "serialNumber": "1234567891",
  "outputExecutionResult": 0,
}
```

## üíæ Final Output

The final output of this tool's execution will be a new file in the specified folder (through the Output Directory argument).
The console will print the path to the file, e.g., C:\Users\Usuari\OS\PROD\shipping\1234567892_241213.json

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Errors
Given the fact that the Onavital Flashing Tool includes user input, it is possible that errors occur. These will be reflected accordingly in the Traceability File. Below is a table that documents and summarizes the error codes:
